My solution was this, using OpenCV and template matching, I designed bot that on given certain restrictions, it will utilize gold coins or energy cards accordingly and automate the attacking process. This reduced my efforts as I don't have to play and my heroes get levelled up to 400 in a matter of few hours. Another use case that I developed is the Hydra bot, a Hydra event in the game has 1000 levels, each having 10 sub levels thus, resulting in 10000 attacks, I applied some similar strategies but with deadlock conditions and now I can clear approximately 800 levels in a matter of 6 hours.",

Under Unicode, in my junior year I was the project lead of DJ Archive, and mentored the rest of the students in their projects. Another project that we deveoped was the College Event manager that is being used by the faculties right now in the college. We also conducted workshops for second and first year students where we taught multifarios topics including Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Object Oriented Programming and Django so that they can take part in Hackathons. Unicode has grown from 45 developers in its first year to roughly 70 developers currently with many deployed and ongoing projects."
